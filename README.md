Inventory app
==================================

Made changes to the solution code for Android Basics with Compose.

Description
------------

This app is an Inventory tracking app. Demos how to add, update, sell, and delete items from the local database.
This app demonstrated the use of Android Jetpack component [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) database.
The app also leverages [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel),
[Flow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow),
and [Navigation](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/navigation/).

New (what I added) - search bar for searching items, order screen to input quantity, and summary to review order.
